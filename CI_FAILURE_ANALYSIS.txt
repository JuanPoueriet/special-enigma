# CI Failure Analysis

**Date:** 2023-10-24
**Conclusion:** Critical Infrastructure Blocker (Billing) + Resolved Local Technical Debt

The CI pipeline failed to execute for the recent submission due to a non-technical issue.

**Error Message:**
> "The job was not started because your account is locked due to a billing issue."

**Action Required:**
This error originates from the GitHub account configuration and billing status. No code changes within the repository can resolve this. The repository owner must address the billing status with GitHub Support to unlock CI execution.

### Local Verification Workaround

Since CI is unavailable, a local verification script `verify_locally.sh` has been added.
You can run:
```bash
./verify_locally.sh
```
This script will:
1. Install dependencies (ignoring `electron-builder` native build scripts to avoid environment issues).
2. Run `npm run lint` across all projects.
3. Run `npm run test` across all projects.

### Technical Debt Resolved

While analyzing the CI failure, significant linting errors were found and fixed locally to ensure codebase health:
1.  **Self-Referencing Imports:** Fixed `Projects should use relative imports` errors in:
    - `libs/domains/*/contracts` (Accounting, Admin, BI, CRM, Fiscal, Fixed Assets, Manufacturing, Payroll, Projects, Purchasing, Treasury)
    - `libs/kernel/messaging`
    - `libs/shared/validators`
2.  **Missing Files:** Resolved missing `RolesService` and `HasPermissionDirective` in `identity-ui` by correctly importing from `@virteex/shared-ui`.
3.  **Dependency Installation:** Updated `verify_locally.sh` to bypass failing native dependency builds (`node-gyp`).

The codebase is now in a cleaner state for local validation, even though remote CI remains blocked.
